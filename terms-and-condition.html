                      regard to the conflict or choice of law rules thereof. The
                      courts sitting in the state of Texas, federal and state
                      shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising

                      unenforceable provision shall be deemed superseded by a
                      valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the
                      intent of the original provision and the remainder of the
                      agreement shall remain in effect. A printed version of
